<h4 style ="font-family:Corben-Regular; font-size:40px;color:white; margin-left:13cm; text-decoration:underline; text-shadow:1px 1px #FF0000;"> WHY SPORTS????? </h4>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Tahoma ; color:white; margin-top:1cm;">Studies offer broad insights into child development and often contradict one another. Since no one child is exactly like another, parents who understand the benefits and pitfalls of sports and who pay attention to the individual needs of their children are more likely to raise kids that thrive in life.  Generally, studies indicate three important aspects of sports participation that affect positive youth development intensity, continuity, and balance. A combination of all three offers the greatest benefits to kids.<p>

<h3 >Intensity</h3>

<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Tahoma ; color:white; margin-top:1cm;">The amount of time children spend doing sports each week is particularly important to whether they receive positive developmental outcomes from their participation. Kids who spend more time in sports activities have greater benefits than youth who participate at lower levels or not at all.  With greater time commitment, children develop better mastery of skills and superior knowledge of tactics and strategy.  This can lead to the development of strategic thinking which is helpful in all aspects of life, including the ability to find and excel in the job market. No one can tell you how many hours of sports per week is the perfect amount. The important learning is that children who make a commitment to regular practice receive greater developmental benefits.</p>

<h3>Continuity</h3>

<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Tahoma ; color:white; margin-top:1cm;">The stability and duration of how children participate across their adolescent years is also important. Studies suggest that intermittent participation during the middle and high school years is not as beneficial as continuous dedication. Making a commitment over time facilitates the likelihood that children will overcome challenges and obstacles in their performance. They also have greater opportunities to interact with teammates, learning to cope with the interpersonal challenges of working with others. This is an important aspect of developing initiative, an internal strength that lasts a lifetime.</p>

<h3>Balance</h3>

<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Tahoma ; color:white; margin-top:1cm;">Perhaps the most important of the three aspects of youth sports participation is to achieve a balance between sports and other activities.  Studies show that greater developmental outcomes are attained by children who spend time in activities other than their dominant sports pursuits. It is not necessarily the numbers of activities in which youth participate, but rather that they have outlets beyond sports. For example, one study found youth who participated in sports and school clubs had lower rates of depression than kids who focused exclusively on sports. Other studies, like the one highlighted in Tomorrowâ€™s Change Makers: Reclaiming the Power of Citizenship for a New Generation, suggest that children who participate in activities that present real-world challenges, like volunteering in their communities, achieve greater developmental benefits. These activities encourage youth to develop a civic identity and see a world beyond a game of competition.</p>
